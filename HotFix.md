# What is a HotFix? #

Every now and then, GC server software is updated. There are two major ways:

  * Web.Release: in the early days, a Release marked a major change in the user interface or database
  * Web.HotFix: meant to corrent wrong behaviour of a previous Release.

Unfortunately, the difference between both isn't as clear anymore. While a Release always comes with Release Notes published in the Groundspeak forum, a HotFix may, or may not, have Release Notes as well. In 2013, a few HotFix updates changed the site behaviour - the most prominent was the 20130821 HotFix which introduced the (new) geocache/ interface replacing the old seek/cache\_details interface.
Dated 20131114, another HotFix introduced an additional cookie. There were no Release Notes announcing this change.
