# What is it? #

GeoToad is a tool for serious <a href='http://www.geocaching.com'>geocachers</a>. It lets you make advanced queries to find the perfect caches to hit on your day out, and export them to any imaginable format. Here is what it can do:

  * On-demand queries for geocaches based on 15 different constraints: query type, distance, difficulty, terrain, fun factor, size, type, unfound, trackables, cache age, last found date, title, description, found by, cache creator.
  * Outputs cache listing and details to HTML, GPX, CSV, VCF, Text, Ozi, MXF, Tiger, GPSPoint, etc.
  * Integrated with <a href='http://www.gpsbabel.org/'>GPSBabel</a> to output to  <a href='http://earth.google.com/'>Google Earth</a> (KML), and dozens of other formats.
  * Optional automatic waypoint names like "`TheBookOfMozilla`" instead of "`GCABE4`"
  * Runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other UNIX flavors!
  * It's Opensource!

GeoToad has been around since 2002, and is written using the <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/'>Ruby Programming Language</a>. We're looking for new people to join in and help develop, debug, and maintain the code. Patches welcome!
